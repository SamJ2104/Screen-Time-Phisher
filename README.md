# Screen-Time-Phisher
## What is it?
Screen time phisher is a web app that allows you to find the screen time password of your phone without your parent knowing.
## How do I use it?
Go to screen-time.samj.app on safari then press the share button and then press add to home screen. You should see a menu asking if you want to add whatsapp to your homescreen, press add (this does not effect your actual whatsapp it is just made to look like the real app)

Go to your homescreen and click the new WhatsApp that has been installed then tell whoever has your password that its asking for a password to go onto whatsapp for some reason.

After they enter the password, simply press the new communtiy button and the password will appear on the screen.
